An attempt to cope with shitty gacha rate that currently popular in mobile gaming.

the workflow inspired by the idea of provable fairness explained in: https://www.bgaming.com/provability_explained.html

it is about time that the customer protections rights, force the game provider that involve any kind of gacha / gambling, provide the proof, that they doesn't tamper the rate, because otherwise, the game provider will always get away, by just saying, "it is your luck, and not our system." no matter how unlikely is a bad luck.
